Reciprocal primitive vectors are divided by the number stored in mesh with (0,0,0) point centering. The centering can be shifted only half of one mesh by setting 1 or true for each is_shift element. If 0 or false is set for is_shift, it means there is no shift. This limitation of shifting enables the irreducible k-point search significantly faster when the mesh is very dense.\n\nThe reducible uniform grid points are returned in reduced coordinates as grid_address. A map between reducible and irreducible points are returned as grid_mapping_table as in the indices of grid_address. The number of the irreducible k-points are returned as the return value.  The time reversal symmetry is imposed by setting is_time_reversal.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
